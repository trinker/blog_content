  Abstract                 = {This literature analysis examines the experiences of Black students in public charter schools in the United States by analyzing the current literature and enrollment data in this domain. Through the investigation of multiple empirical studies that examine the effects of charter schools on the academic achievement and enrollment trends of Black students, the author introduces the concept of "The Black Charter School Effect." The Black Charter School Effect encompasses the ability of public charter schools to successfully attract, and in many cases, educate Black students. This analysis offers implications for policymakers to consider the redesign of state charter laws that impact urban communities, [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this meta-analysis is to analyze the difference of student achievement between charter schools and other public schools using standardized mean-change measures. Although many researchers have studied the effects of charter schools on student achievement, the results of those studies are mixed and unclear. According to this research synthesis of 395 mean-change effect sizes of 13 studies, charter school students' test scores over time are slightly higher than those of other public schools by 0.06 standard deviations. Further- more, the results of fixed-effects regression analysis by duration reveal that the coefficient is positive. Although it is a small difference, this indicates that students' learning gains in charter schools are higher than other public schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  Abstract                 = {Individuals do not develop into educated, competent members of society by learning academic skills without accompanying social skills. Indeed, a set of appropriate social skills is one of the most vital characteristics of a well-rounded individual capable of full participation in a democratic society. For this reason, far-reaching legislation, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, must include provisions to ensure instruction of the whole child. The principles of teaching social behavior are identical to those of teaching cognitive skills; they are assessment, planning, instruction, and evaluation.},
